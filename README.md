# Project 1 Portfolio Analysis - Tech Stocks vs Consumer Stocks

We will be projecting future returns of a portfolio comprised of five consumer stocks as well as a a portfolio comprised of 5 tech stocks over a 15 and 20 year period in order to evaluate the better long term buy. The asset allocation between between stocks and bonds will remain the same between both portfolios.

The Stocks we will be analyzing are

Consumer Stocks:
* P&G
* Johnson and Johnson
* Walmart
* Kellogg
* Coca Cola

Tech Stocks:

# Usage

The asset allocation between stocks & bonds within the portfolio will remain the same between both portfolios (80-20 split), and the percent allocation between stocks within each fund will be the same as well. The inclusion of bonds in these portfolios in this exercise will allow the portfolios to mimic the investment style of the average investor. Each portfolio will be assigned a cost basis of $50,000; furthermore the portfolios will be assigned expense ratios that are consistent with index funds that represent the holdings similar to that of our sample portfolios.

First we are importing the data that we gathered for each stocks
